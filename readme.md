repo for une ai competition

#### 5th of January, 2025
In an ideal world I would have more time to implement my idea(s) for this 
competition, I have three but I think that only one is achievable in two weeks
with my current knowledge of neural networks.

1. Traffic light control  - An AI that monitors traffic and changes lights
depending on conditions and volume of traffic/accidents/emergency vechiles, etc
2. Journaling app - A bit plain but essentially an everyday journal that would
train itself from your entries and recommend things or remind you or things you
keep mentioning and perhaps not doing, or sense when you are happy or sad and
help adjust, I don't know, seems complicated and a little intrusive, but that
is what a journal is i guess.
3. Financial management system - An AI that manages and adjusts your assets/
trading accounts/whatever by monitoring market conditions and implementing either
a predefined strategy or one it learns by itself. You could select how much
risk you are willing to take on and it can adjust for that in terms of different
assets, timeframes, etc. A literal self managed super fund essentially.

All three ideas are pretty much the same thing. Get realtime data, make a decision
on that data, run through logic to execute whatever aligns with that decision.
I think the financial management system is the easiest to implement at my current
skill level, as its basically just binary classification. A journaling app using 
NLP is something I haven't tried yet so I might be too tight on time and my 
favourite idea (traffic light control) seems kind of impossible as i'm not sure
if I can get access to real time traffic data and even if I could I would have 
to set up a model with a bunch of parameters and that seems like a daunting task.
So I think it's the financial management system for now.

Built alot today, made some decision, not happy with all of them, very happy with
how others turned out. Project is mostly complete in at this point, just have to
decide if im going to connect it to an actual exchange to trade for the competition 
or create a simulation to trade off the last couple hundred days with a fake balance
but real data... decide tomorrow, probably implement both and make a settings menu
or something. I'm tired, alot of messy code to clean up tomorrow, alot of converting
to classes i think.
